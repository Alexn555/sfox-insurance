## First (primary) way to execute 
  Uses Webpack 5
   1. npm install
   this command will install webpack and all required plugins

   2. then use command:
     npm start , runs dev server (with disabled intentionally dev-server error overlay )
     npm run build, builds the appliation in dist folder


## How to execute  
  You need to install simple node HTTP server
  
   1. npm install -g live-server // Install globally via npm
   2. then cd to src folder
       npm run command 
		live-server     

    C:\node_projects\sfox-insruance\src>live-server
    Serving "C:\node_projects\sfox-insruance\src" at http://127.0.0.1:8080

   Should now in browser be: http://127.0.0.1:8080/ as host for the Application

   After that all modules and parts of Application are runnable


## Compatability
  Works well in all modern Desktop resolutions on most browsers. <br />
  Also Mobile-friendly and can be useful on mobile devices.

## Tests
  Mainly Chrome and mobile viewport, but also looks good on Firefox latest, Edge latest
